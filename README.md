KMeans: 
This jupyter notebook is the first attempt at replicating the KMeans analysis done in 
our paper. However, this analysis is not actually used when the researchers talk about 
their findings. The KMeans is used for researchers to initially look for patterns between 
diseases. This jupyter notebook walks through an example of how the researchers might 
look at disease prevalence to continue onto other ways to identify subgroups.
